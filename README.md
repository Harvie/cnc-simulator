### Origins
This simulator was originaly part of [JSCut](https://jscut.org/) discontinued CAM package by [Todd Fleming](https://github.com/tbfleming/jscut).

It was later isolated and modified to be useful in offline/standalone context by [Tomas Mudrunka](https://github.com/harvie).

Similar project used to be available at www.cncwebtools.com/Apps/GCode_Simulator/index.html but features were limited and the website is now defunct.
